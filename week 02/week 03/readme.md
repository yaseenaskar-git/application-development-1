# Simple NodeJS Assignment

### Previous experience
I previously tried to create a web app (not for academic purposes), and as a result of that project, I already had Node.js installed on my device and had seen package.json and other JS application development related files as well. Since I was working with AI to code as I had very little knowledge about application development, my focus was on my prompts to the AI rather than learning what the files I was seeing were and how to code in JS.

### Resources used
As I have no prior learning experience with JS, I did some google searches and used chatGPT to understand some JS basics. Moreover, I also used ChatGPT for trouble shooting and error handling.

Note: Despite ChatGPT giving me the complete answer, I still had some errors and this is because I did not completely copy and paste from ChatGPT. I tried to write the code myself but whenever an error occoured, I went back to ChatGPT. Unfortunatelly, I did not record all my changes in Git as I forgot about having to add and push, but an older version of my package.json with my mistakes was recorded for proof. Also, the chat log shows that I am asking for help with errors regarding code that ChatGPT has already provided.

### What package.json does
package.json is a file that lists the metadata of a Node.js project, including but not limited to version, scripts (lines of code used for certain project commands like running and testing), dependencies (the softwares and versions a user needs to run the project on their device, basically prerequisites), and more. 

### What process.env is
process.env is a build in tool in Node.js that provides project environment varibales. These environment variables can be modified as well.

### What npm start runs
npm stands for node package manager, and npm start runs the start script in the package.json file. Usually, this is used to run the project. The same thing can be said about npm run dev.

### Assignment errors
Given my prior experience with Node.js, I am used to running commands on cmd rather than the VS Code terminal, and that is how I started this assignment. Later when I wanted to follow the assignment and run: npm run from the vs code terminal via powershell, I ran into some system security errors which can be seen in the chat log with ChatGPT. After fixing some syntax errors as well, I went back to cmd to do npm run and that is where I completed the project.
