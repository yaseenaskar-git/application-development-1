# Week04 Homework Reflection

### 1. What was the original bug, and why did Node throw an error?

The original bug was that discount was an undefined variable that was being used inside the applyDiscount function operation.

### 2. How did logging help explain program behavior?

The logging helped explain the program by showing a step by step procedure of what the program is executing. Today, I learned that the placement of the log statements matters a lot in order to tell a proper story of what the program is doing.

### 3. Why is testing better than manually re-running the script?

Testing is an automated process that can help nullify human error when having to re-run the script. In addition, testing makes the process of debugging faster compared to manual debugging. 

### 4. Which test would you keep if you could only keep one, and why?

I would keep the applied discount test because in the context of shopping, the employee or customer will be able to tell if the cost or price is 0 or negative in case the error occurs, but no one will know if the discounts happened or not, so I think it is important to test for them.
